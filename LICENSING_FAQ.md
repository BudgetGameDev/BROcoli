## Why did we adopt ELv2?
We needed to find a great way to execute our mission and to create a sustainable project.

ELv2 gives us the best of both worlds.

On one hand, open source users can use our software freely, and on the other hand, we can safely create a sustainable business and continue to invest in the community, project and product. We don't have to worry about other large companies hosting a competing product, thereby limiting the funding we have for running the project, hurting this community in the process.

## Scenario guide

These examples are provided to reduce ambiguity. The license text in `LICENSE` controls.

### Clearly permitted
- **Home server:** You run the Software privately for your own use.
- **Internal enterprise:** Your company runs the Software internally for employees.
- **SaaS application built with the Software:** You build an application using the Software; your users interact with your application (your UI, your domain model), not with the Software’s platform features directly.
- **Customer on-prem:** You install the Software in a customer’s environment; the customer operates it.
- **Fork & experiment:** You fork the repo and run your fork privately.

### Likely prohibited
- **Hosted platform competitor:** You provide a hosted experience in a way that competes with the Official Hosted Services.
- **“Managed instance” resale:** You operate the Software for customers as a service where they effectively use the Software itself (not just your app).

### Edge cases (ask first)
- **Dedicated hosting for a single customer:** If you operate the Software for a customer as a service (even on dedicated infrastructure), this can still look like a hosted/managed service. Contact the Licensor for clarification or separate commercial terms.
- **MSP/outsourcing arrangements:** If you run the Software on behalf of many customers as part of your service offering, that can cross into hosted/managed service territory.
